# how_to: Use This Resource
As a starting point, however works for you!  I have used a lot of free resources in my journey to learn to code, and wanted to help others who may be going through the same process!
## Structure
At the top level, topics are arranged by languages, with an additional directory for cross-language topics.  For example, 'how_to_vs_code' and 'how_to_command_line' contains topics that relate to many programming languages.
## Organizational Principles
1. Each language directory is organized by tasks.
2. Each task has a single .md file in the language's directory.
3. There are no sub-directories within a language.
4. Tasks are functionality oriented, and should be named using a verb phrase.
5. Within each .md file:  
    - The first Header1 should be title 'Overview' and should contain a 4-20 paragraph written description of the task to be acomplished (the file name) and the method(s) of accomplishing proposed.
    - The next Header1 should identify the preferred method of accomplishing the task.
    - If there are multiple methods of accomplishing, the should each have their own Header1
    - Below each Header1:  plain paragrpah with numbered steps is preferred.  Header2, Header3, and styling should be used sparingly and only when doing so promotes overall clartiy on complicated tasks.
    - Every line should have a comment, unless a previous comment explains explicitly what the next several lines accomplish.
