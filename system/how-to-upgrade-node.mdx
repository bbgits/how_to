# how to upgrade and ACTIVATE versions of Node.Js and other programs on linux

It is time.  You probably got an error like this: 

""

or like this:

""

or maybe one of your peers saw your version number and looked at you like this:

For whatever reason, you need to upgrade Node.js and your having some problems.

Here's what worked for me:

## 1. Check current version

Well, first, check your current version:

`node -v`

## Download and install 'n' to manage

Now, because managine node versions can be a pain, someone made a program called 'n' that makes the process easier.  Open up a terminal in your computer's home directory and run this to download 'n' and install it globally:

`npm install -g n`

Now use **n** to get the latest version of node

`n latest`

At this point, you may get a succes message saying that you've installed node - but your problems might not be fixed yet. Close your terminal, and open another, then try running `node -v` again to see what version is being used.

This is because **n** installs the package, but it is not in the directory that your computer is using.  If you run `n latest` again, you will see a message like this:

```
   installed : v20.1.1 to /installed/location/n/bin/node
      active : v12.14.1 at /active/location/bin/node
```

copy the contents of the installed location to the active location using:

` cp /installed/location/n/bin/node /active/location/bin/node`

now check `node -v` and the update should be complete!
