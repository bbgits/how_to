# How to Get Started With Git 
Git is a version control system for code that standardizes how updates to a directory are updated and saved over time. Instead of clicking "Save As" and then naming an updated file "index-temp-02" to indicate progress made that might not be ready to be implemented fully, Git provides a mechanism for working on individual branches, saving those branches, and then merging those branches with the main branch when it is ready to do so.

## VIP Workflow: New Repo
### 1. CREATE REPO 
- log in to github.com
- click "create new repo"
- answer prompts, etc 
- once created, COPY the URL on the main page of repo 
### 2. CREATE GIT LOCALLY
- in top level of existing project:        
    - `git init`
- change name of primary branch to 'main':
    - `git branch -m main`
### 3. CREATE FIRST COMMIT 
- ADD All Changes to Staging Area:
    - `git add .` or `git add -A`
    - these are 'staged', but not committed yet
- COMMIT Staged Changes with Message:
    -  `git commit -m 'first commit'`
    
### 4. LINK LOCAL GIT TO REPO ON GITHUB
- Using URL from step 1, run: `git remote add origin <URL-from-step-1>`

### 5. PUSH!
- `git push -u origin main`  

#
## VIP Workflow: Save Progress
### 1. Add Updates to Staging Area
- `git add -A` (adds all updates in entire repo)
- or `git add .` (adds all updates from current directory)
### 2. Commit Staged Changes with Message
-  `git commit -m 'updated readme documentation'`
### 3. Push Changes (default to main branch)
-  `git push`
#
## VIP Git Commands
Initialize git in the current directory:
`git init`

Create new directory and start git:
`git init exampleproj`

Add all directories: `git add .`
- directories that are 'added' are staged for commit but have not yet been committed!

Create commit with message: `git commit -m 'first commit for blog'`
- changes that are 'committed' are finalized locally and ready final step!
